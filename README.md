# open-science-methods
This is the repository for projects in the "Open Science Methodologies" for the 3rd Jack Eddy Symposium. It is a place for scripts, issues, discussions, resources related to those projects


*Below are some useful links that network our Symposium to many existing pockets of progress and remarkable groups. Please use these and add those that you are away of*
